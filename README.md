Welcome to my project!  

You may be asking, “Why Astronomy?”.  Well, where I grew up there are amazing views of the Milky Way. I lived in the country and street lighting was not as popular as it is today, So there was nothing interfering with the view.  That was the beginning of my love of the stars and Astronomy.  This love remained but often took a backseat to other interests.  This capstone seemed to be the perfect time to explore my interests. 

Today we are focusing on Exoplanets.  Extrasolar Planets are those that orbit a star and that are not in our solar system.  This means they are outside our stars influence. 
(insert more on exoplants) 

I found my CSVs via a Kaggle search and followed them back to a NASA website which provided more information and eventually led to the interactive site (https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/exo/#/system/K2-17) where I found the information about the distance the planets are from Earth.

Classes of planets:

Class A

1 to 1/10th the mass of Earth
Newly formed 
suns cold zone
Molten Surfaces
when cooled will be Class C planets
type= Geothermal

Class B
1/10th the mass of earth
in its Suns Hot zone
weak gravity and tenuous atmospheres
type: geomorteus


Class CWelcome to my project!  You may be asking, “Why Astronomy?”.  I grew up  with amazing views of the Milky Way, since I lived in the country and street lighting was not as popular as it is today.  So there was nothing interfering with the view.  That was the beginning of my love of the stars.

Today we are focusing on Exoplanets.  Extrasolar Planets are those that orbit a star and that are not in our solar system.  This means also that they supposed to be outside our stars influence.

Classes of planets:

Class C
1 to 1/10 the mass of Earth
in their suns cold zone
atmospheres are permanently frozen
type: geoinactive
example: Pluto

Class D
size: 1 to 1/100th the mass of Earth.  Possible could be less.   
These planets have no atmospheres
surface are lifeless and cratered due to radiation exposure and impacts of  meteors
Type: Asteroid / Moon
Examples: Moon (Sol IIIa)

Class E
typically of about the mass of Earth 
in their sun's habitable zone. 
surfaces are still molten. 
Their atmospheres still retain many hydrogen compounds
will cool, becoming Class F.
Type: Geoplastic
Examples: Excalbia

Class C
Classl.jpg
Class C planets are small, typically 1 to 1/10 the mass of Earth and are in their sun's cold zone. Due to a combination of low solar radiation and little heat, their atmospheres are permanently frozen.

Type: Geoinactive
Age: 2 - 10 billion years
Diameter: 1,000 - 10,000 km
Location: Ecosphere / Cold Zone
Surface: Low surface temperature
Atmosphere: Frozen
Evolution: n.a.
Life-Forms: None
Examples: Pluto, Psi 2000
Class D
Classo.jpg
Class D planets are small, typically 1 to 1/100 the mass of Earth, or less. Due to low gravity, they have lost their atmospheres. Their surfaces, directly exposed to radiation and meteor impact, are typically lifeless and heavily cratered.

Type: Asteroid / Moon
Age: 2 - 10 billion years
Diameter: 100 - 1,000 km
Location: Hot Zone / Ecosphere / Cold Zone; found primarily in orbit of larger planets or in asteroid fields
Surface: Barren and cratered
Atmosphere: None or very tenuous
Evolution: n.a.
Life-Forms: None
Examples: Moon (Sol IIIa), Lunar V (Bajor VIIe)
Class E
Classd.jpg
Class E planets are typically of about the mass of Earth and are in their sun's habitable zone. They are newly formed, and their surfaces are still molten. Their atmospheres still retain many hydrogen compounds, as well as reactive gases and rock vapors. These planets will cool, becoming Class F.

Type: Geoplastic
Age: 0 - 2 billion years
Diameter: 10,000 - 15,000 km
Location: Ecosphere
Surface: Molten, high surface temperature
Atmosphere: Hydrogen compunds and reactive gases
Evolution: Cools to become Class F
Life-Forms: Carbon-cyle (ie. Excalbian)
Examples: Excalbia
same size as Class As
in suns cold zone
amosphers are permanently frozen
type: geoinactive,
